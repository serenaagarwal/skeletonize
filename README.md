Plot skeleton thins or partially thins an image or series of images, and then plots them.

somabranchseries.py takes binary soma and branch images, skeletonizes the branches, then adds together the soma and skeletonized branches.

somabranchskel.py does the same, but for a series of somas and a series of branches.
